                👋 - Hi! My name is Adwait Ganguly, and I am a sophomore studying Computer Science and Business Analytics & Information Technology (BAIT) at the Honors College at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. 
                
                👨‍💻 - My career interests are focused on Software Engineering, but in the long run, I am extremely driven to build my own company. 

                💻 - I am an avid programmer, and the process of building software from start to finish is one of the few things that can grasp my attention for hours on end. 

                📸 - In my free time, you can find me reading, playing tennis and soccer, or even taking photos!

                Feel free to reach out to ganguly.adwait@gmail.com with any questions, opportunities, or collaborations!
