        <p>My first experience with programming came when I took a half-year course on VisualBasic in my freshman year of highschool. 
            At first the class was tough, and I struggled immensely. I just couldn't seem to wrap my head around programming. I remember at I would need 
            to ask my classmates how to do even the simplest of tasks on most of our projects. However, the day before the final of the class, I finally decided
            to go to my father for help. Surprisingly, all it took was about an hour of explanation to get a better understanding of everything I had been taught
            in class. For the first time I did not feel overwhelmed about programming. I went in to class the next day and recieved an A on my final. I had
            actually began to enjoy coding but the problem was that I didn't know where to go from there.</p>

        <p>After 2 years of not paying much mind to programming, a horrible and deadly pandemic somehow brought it back to me. Scrolling through Youtube one 
            day a tutorial on Python caught my eye. As I was stuck in quarantine with nothing to do I  decided <span style="font-style:italics;"> Why Not?</span>.
            Not more than 15 minutes into the course, I remembered how I felt at the end of my VisualBasic class. I truly enjoyed programming. I finished the tutorial
            within a month, and had gained the fundamentals of Python.

        <p>I am currently writing this blog after learning HTML and CSS, and I can't wait to keep going. Hopefully I can put these skills to use soon. 
           I will be learning Java in AP Computer Science A during my coming senior year in highschool and I think my experience in this class will be much 
           than that of my freshman year.
