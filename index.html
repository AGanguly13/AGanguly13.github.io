        <h6>August 10, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>My first experience with programming came when I took a half-year course on VisualBasic in my freshman year of highschool. I did not pay attention in the class, nor did I have any interest in programmin in the class. The only reason I passed the class with an A- was copying my classmates code and asking my dad to explain basically the entire language to me in one night. However, I  realized in that one night that if I actually put my mind to it, I could  actually enjoy programming.</p>

        <h6>August 10, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>I decided to revisit programming because I  wanted to pick up a new skill during he coronavirus pandemic, but I also wanted to revisit the night in freshman year where I sparked a curiosity to code. I took an hour long course on the basics of Python on Udemy.com, but not much of the information stuck with me. I followed up by beginning a 6 hour course on Python, and the information finally began to stick. However, my focus was largely placed in preparing for college applications in the fall, and I had barely gotten through 3 hours of the course by August, even though I started in May. Still, I had gotten familiar with the basics of Python. </p>
        <h2 id="Opp" class="Header">Oppurtunity?</h2>
        <h6>August 10, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>I had been looking for a part-time job or internship in the STEM field throughout the summer, and I finally saw an oppurtunity after participating in an Engineering Competition and placing in the Top 10. I applied to the job for the Web Developer Position even though I still only barely knew Python. To my surprise, I landed an interview, and so thus here we are. I am currently learning HTML and CSS, and plan to move on to JavaScript next. </p>
